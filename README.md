# githubactions

## Commit Convention

* feature, fix, perf, and BREAKING CHANGE: paragraphs, will bump the version and be included in the changelog

* docs will appear in the changelog for the next release, but does not trigger a version bump on its own

* style, refactor, test, chore have no effect (unless you add them to changelog-sections)
